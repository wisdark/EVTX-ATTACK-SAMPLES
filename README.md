This is a container for windows events samples associated to specific attack and post-exploitation techniques. 
Can be useful for:

- Testing your detection scripts based on EVTX parsing

- Training on DFIR and threat hunting using event logs

- Designing detection use cases using Windows and Sysmon event logs

- Avoid/Bypass the noisy techniques if you are a redteamer

N.B: Mapping has been done to the level of ATT&CK technique (not procedure), some items are marked in grey, meaning couldn't found a closer TTP that achieves same objective. 

Below a summarized overview of the covered TTPs using attack-navigator:
